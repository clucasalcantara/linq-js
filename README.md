# forofa.js

A lazy iteration library that wraps any iterator protocol type into a fluent-api, allowing javascript default array prototype functions to be used with iterators. This way it increases performance with some functions and allows lazy iteration.

This library takes advantage of the iterator protocol provided in ES2015 and it takes inspiration from C#'s Linq library.
